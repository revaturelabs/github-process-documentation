# Starting work on a Feature

See [Branching Stratagy]() for a description of the branching strategy that will be used for projects and why.

* Checkout the dev branch `git checkout dev`
* Create a new branch for the feature `git checkout -b <feature-name>`
* Begin working on implementing the feature
* Commit work
  * When you are committing remember to include the [ISSUE KEY]() one the first line of the commit message. If the setup.sh script has been run you will be prompted to do so before committing.
* Once work is finished on a feature open a Pull Request (PR) to the dev and showcase branches (See [Opening a PR]())
